# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Problem Statement :

In the banking industry, detecting credit card fraud using machine learning is not just a trend; it is a necessity for banks, as they need to put proactive monitoring and fraud prevention mechanisms in place. Machine learning helps these institutions reduce time-consuming manual reviews, costly chargebacks and fees, and denial of legitimate transactions.

## Business Goal :

Develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions based on the historical transactional data of customers with a pool of merchants

## Steps Followed
1.Reading Data

2.Handling Null Values, Cleaning data

3.Visualising the data-EDA

4.Dummy variables

5.Spliting dataset into train and test set

6.Building Random Forest model

7.Prediction using final model

8.Model Evaluation

9.Conclusion
